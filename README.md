Requirements
=============
* Haiku R1-alpha4 gcc2 or greater. (gcc2 hybrid is recommended)
* Latest Haiku nightlies.

Compiling from source
======================

* First, clone this respository.
* Change the current directory to the source directory.
  ```bash
   cd HaikuDemoApp/
  ```

* Run '**make**' in the Terminal.
* Done.

#BeOS R5/Magnussoft Zeta/etc Compatibility Note
Although the Haiku API is slightly similar to the original BeAPI, this demo has not yet been tested to compile on BeOS R5 or Zeta. Since the recent API changes in Haiku, API compatibility for BeOS, Zeta and other clones is not yet guaranteed or fully supported. This demo so far works on Haiku R1-alpha4 gcc2/gcc4 and newer.
