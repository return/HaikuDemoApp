Requirements
=============
* Haiku R1-alpha4 gcc2 or greater.
* Latest Haiku nightlies.

Compiling from source
======================

* First, clone this respository.
* Change the current directory to the source directory.

   cd HaikuDemoApp/
  ```

* Run '**make**' in the Terminal.
* Done.

##BeOS R5/Zeta Compatibility Note
This demo has not yet been tested to compile on BeOS R5 or Zeta. Since the recent API changes in Haiku, API compatibility for BeOS or Zeta is not yet guaranteed or fully supported. This demo so far works on Haiku R1-alpha4 gcc2/gcc4 and newer.
